# regex_crossword_solutions
A silly repo for holding my answers from [regexcrossword.com](https://regexcrossword.com)!

Hoping to finish all of these before the end of year, somehow these are kind of fun. Not sure why. üê•

For example, take problem 1:

#  Level 1: The OR symbol..
In this example, the goal is to enter the correct regex into the square that fufills all of the surrounding regex.
RegEx | swappe for "or" for markdown table compliance üò≠.
|  | A or B |
| ------ | ------ |
| A or Z | ? |

Answer in: `1-tutorial`

# Level 2: Ghost
|  | [COBTRA]+ | (AB or O or OR)+ |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| (.)+\1 |  ?  | ? |
| [^ABRC] | ? | ?|
